This is self created project to do list and file operations in Python.
The purpose is to do simple CRUD {Create|Read|Update|Delete} operations on a CSV (comman separated values) file.

It has two files:

[1] db_interface: The file that launches a CLI and accepts user-input
[2] memory_db: A file that reads/writes to disk and actually performs the CRUD operations
